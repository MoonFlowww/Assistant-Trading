How to use it is quite simple.

Launch init, then a console opens. Now the program is running, but there's one missing piece: the database. Fortunately, we can create one by a very simple trick, in the menu you have an option called "Database" if you press the associated number and ENTER, you can go to the DATABASE menu.
Now you just have to press the number associated with Create Database and ENTER again. 

The program now will works perfectly.
